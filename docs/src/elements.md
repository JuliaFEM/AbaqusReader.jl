# Supported Elements

AbaqusReader.jl supports 60+ ABAQUS element types across multiple categories. Element variants (e.g., C3D8R, C3D8H) with the same node count map to the same generic element type, as the package focuses on mesh topology rather than analysis-specific details like integration schemes.

## Element Suffix Meanings

Understanding the suffix letters helps in selecting the right element:

- **R** = **Reduced integration** - Fewer integration points, faster computation, may need finer mesh to avoid hourglassing in first-order elements
- **H** = **Hybrid formulation** - Independent pressure interpolation for nearly incompressible or fully incompressible materials
- **I** = **Incompatible modes** - Enhanced for better bending behavior, eliminates parasitic shear stresses
- **M** = **Modified formulation** - Improved performance with minimal locking, works well in contact problems
- **E** = **Enhanced strain** - Improved formulation for certain applications

## Quick Selection Guide

- **Need accuracy with coarse mesh?** Use second-order elements (10, 15, 20, 8 nodes)
- **Need computational efficiency?** Use reduced integration (R suffix) with adequate mesh density
- **Nearly incompressible material?** Use hybrid elements (H suffix)
- **Bending-dominated problem?** Consider incompatible modes (I suffix) or second-order elements
- **Contact analysis?** Consider modified elements (M suffix, e.g., C3D10M)
- **Avoid** first-order triangles and tets (C3D4, CPS3, CPE3, CAX3) except as filler elements

## Adding New Element Types

Adding support for new ABAQUS element types is straightforward - element definitions are stored in a TOML database file rather than in code. See the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for detailed instructions.
